What We Understood from the Output 

From the analysis of 1,470 employees, we learned that employee attrition is not random.
About 237 employees left, giving an overall attrition rate of 16.12%.
This level of turnover can impact productivity, recruitment costs, and team stability.

⸻

1. Attrition is a business risk
	•	Total Employees: 1,470
	•	Employees Left: 237
	•	Attrition Rate: 16.12%

This means roughly 1 in every 6 employees left the organization, making retention a serious business concern.

⸻

2. Sales and HR face the highest attrition
	•	Sales: 20.63%
	•	Human Resources: 19.05%
	•	R&D: 13.84%

Sales and HR employees leave more often than those in R&D.
This suggests higher pressure, demanding targets, or role stress in these departments.

⸻

3. New employees leave the most
	•	Early Tenure (0–3 yrs): 25.96%
	•	Mid Tenure (4–7 yrs): 12.71%
	•	Long Tenure (8+ yrs): 10.42%

Employees in their first three years are more than 2x as likely to leave compared to long-term employees.
This points to onboarding, expectation mismatch, or cultural adjustment issues.

⸻

4. Overtime strongly increases attrition
	•	Overtime Employees: 30.53% attrition
	•	Non-overtime Employees: 10.44% attrition

Employees working overtime are nearly 3 times more likely to leave.
This highlights burnout, workload imbalance, and poor work-life balance as major drivers.

⸻

5. Pay differences influence retention
	•	Employees who stayed: ₹6,833 avg/month
	•	Employees who left: ₹4,787 avg/month

Employees who left earned about 30% less on average.
This suggests compensation competitiveness affects retention decisions.

⸻

6. Satisfaction and work-life balance matter
	•	Stayed employees:
	•	Job Satisfaction: 2.78
	•	Work-Life Balance: 2.78
	•	Employees who left:
	•	Job Satisfaction: 2.47
	•	Work-Life Balance: 2.66

Lower satisfaction and poorer work-life balance are clearly linked to higher attrition.

⸻

Overall Understanding (With Data)

Employees are more likely to leave when:
	•	They are new (25.96% attrition)
	•	They work overtime (30.53% attrition)
	•	They earn less (₹4,787 vs ₹6,833)
	•	They feel less satisfied
	•	They work in high-pressure roles (Sales: 20.63%)

So, attrition is predictable and manageable.

⸻

What This Means for the Business

To reduce attrition, the company should:
	•	Strengthen onboarding for early employees
	•	Control overtime and workload
	•	Support Sales and HR teams
	•	Review compensation structures
	•	Improve employee engagement and work-life balance

This transforms data into actionable workforce strategy.
